      Installation may fail if you install only for the current user and a previous version was installed for all users. To fix this, either:
      <ol>
        <li>Install for all users, or</li>
        <li>Manually delete <code>/Library/Input Methods/KeyMagic.app</code> and try installing again.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
